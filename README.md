🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting crop yield using basic machine learning techniques.
The goal is to understand how factors such as soil conditions and weather data can influence agricultural output and how data-driven models can support decision-making.

🧠 Problem Statement

Farmers often rely on experience and intuition to estimate crop yield. This project explores how machine learning can help predict yield more systematically using available data.

🛠️ Approach

Collected and preprocessed soil and weather-related data

Applied a regression-based machine learning model

Trained and tested the model using Python

Compared predictions across different input conditions to analyze performance

🔧 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

ML Technique: Regression

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Results

The model was able to capture trends between input features and crop yield

Predictions varied based on soil and weather inputs, highlighting key influencing factors

Helped understand the role of data analysis in agriculture-focused applications

(This project was intended for learning and experimentation rather than real-world deployment.)
